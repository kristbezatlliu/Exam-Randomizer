# Testi-Me-Alternativa
Version: 1.0
Published the program to GITHUB.

ENGLISH
In order to make this program work, you must have a "Questions.txt" File created inside the folder where the .exe file is located.
You must create the questions in the following format:

Have a curly line symbol (The key located where 1 is, left to that) at the beginning of each question. 
Next, type the question you want.
After that, proceed to type 4 alternatives, A) B) C) and D). (it must be 4 alternatives).
The first alternative is ALWAYS the correct one. This makes it easier for the teacher to just look at the questions.txt file and check the answers.

~This is an example question, how many years can a human live?
A) 70 years
B) 150 years
C) 10 years
D) 50 years

Once finished writing as many questions as you want, proceed to save the text file, and then you can open the .exe file in order to make the exam sheets.
First thing that happens when you open the .exe file, you will be asked to input the amount of exam sheets you want to create, after you enter the amount, the program will 
create a new folder where the text files containing the randomized questions and alternatives will be. If you wish to create new exam sheets, just take the folder somewhere
else in your computer or simply delete it.
